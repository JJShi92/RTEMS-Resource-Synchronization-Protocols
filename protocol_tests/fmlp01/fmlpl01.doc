This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: overhead

directives:

  - DFLPL/FMLPL functions (unlock/lock) (edit the right one before testing)

concepts:

  - This test should test the DFLPL/FMLPL update priority function. We first have the main task obtaining and migrate. On the sychronization processor BLOCK has a higher priority tahn main, thus BLOCK gets the processor and not the migrated task main. After a while BLOCK starts task3 which obtains the same DFLPL semaphore as main. Since main already has the sempahore locked it gets enqueued into a FIFO queue and
inherits their priority to main which now has a higher priority than BLOCK and will preempt block on the synchronization processor.
