This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: overhead

directives:

  - DPCP functions (unlock/lock)

concepts:

  - This is the same test as dpcp01, except that it uses three cores and migr2 is starting on CPU#2
  
  - This test is a short test, to test how the programm is going to behave if there are two DPCP semaphores with different ceiling priority migrating 
    on the same synchronization cpu. CPU#0 is the application processor and CPU#1 the synchronization processor.
    Priority order of the tasks at the beginning migr2 > migr1 > task2 > task1
    priority ceiling of the semaphores sid1 > sid2
   
    migr2, task2 obtains sid2 semaphore
    migr1 obtains sid1 semaphore
    task2 can only finish its critical section after the execution of migr1 and migr2
