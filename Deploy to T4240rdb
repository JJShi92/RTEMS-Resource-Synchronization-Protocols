Guide for deploying RTEMS applications on the T4240:
This guide assumes that the image data is already created with RTEMS: powerpc qoriq_e6500_64

This tests a deployed with a tftpd-hpa server.
The config file in etc/default looked like this when I did the tests. Make sure only the tftp-hpa server is running 
and not another tftp server. Also make sure the port is set to 69.

# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/home/jan/ba/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS=":69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="-l -c -s"

===================tftp server commands
sudo service tftpd-hpa start
sudo service tftpd-hpa status
sudo service tftpd-hpa restart


Setup of the T4240:
1. Connect Serial Cable with the USB Adapter.
2. Connect the Cable with the UART Port on the T4240 on to a USB Port on the PC.
3. Connect the T4240 to a router with a LAN cable.
4. Connect you pc with the same router.

I used minicom to capture the data send by the T4240 with the serial cable.
-> sudo minicom -s 
   to start with the config menu. Set the usb port in "Serial port setup"
   
Start the T4240 after you configure minicom.   
Abort the autobbot of the board by pressing a random buttom.

Now set up the ips in the board with these commands
setenv serverip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Computer Ip 
setenv ipaddr xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Board Ip
setenv gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Router Ip
save everything with saveenv


copy the dtb file and your RTEMS image into your tftp folder
====================loading image to board
tftp 1000000 dispatch.img
tftp c00000 t4240rdb.dtb
bootm 1000000 - c00000
